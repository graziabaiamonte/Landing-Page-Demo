// DIFFERENZA TRA TYPE E INTERFACE

        A Comprehensive Comparison of TypeScript Type vs Interface
        Types in TypeScript are more flexible and can define primitive, 
        intersection, union, tuple, or different types of data, while 
        interfaces are used to describe the shape of an object. Types use the type 
        keyword for creating new type, while interfaces use the interface keyword 
        for declaring an interface.
